# Plangothic Project

## Overview
The goal of Plangothic Project (Chinese: 遍黑体项目) is to produce a sans-serif styled font that supplement all the extension blocks of CJK Unified Ideographs based on [Source Han Sans](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans) CN. The project was initiated by Fitzgerald Yu around June 2020.

## Coverage

We have completed CJK Extensions C, D, G and H, Extension C requiring further refinement. Extension E will be completed soon. Other blocks are partly available.

## Production

Everyone is welcome to participate in the production of Plangothic Project. You can join our QQ group [1135661191](https://jq.qq.com/?_wv=1027&k=xRTzFAfD) for detailed discussion and questioning.

This is a long-term project. We would be grateful if you could promote the project to others. We are always looking for skilled, devoted font producers to join us. The project cannot be achieved without your promotion and encouragement.

## License
This font is derived from Source Han Sans and released under the SIL Open Font License. See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for details.

All the fonts under the project can be used by any individual, enterprise or team for free. Please note that it is strictly forbidden to use the reserved names “Plangothic” and “遍黑” when making modified versions, and the modified versions must be released under the SIL Open Font License.

It is strictly prohibited for any individual, enterprise or team to sell the font file (including but not limited to selling the font file separately, bundling it with other fonts, or asking for payment to use the font, etc.). If you have paid for this font, please report immediately and assist the relevant judicial authorities if necessary.

## FAQ
**Q1**: Why are there two font files for Plangothic?

**A1**: Because the maximum number of glyphs a font can hold is limited (to 65535), while the total number of Chinese characters is much larger than this value.

**Q2**: What is the difference between *fallback* and *allideo* versions for P1?

**A2**: The *fallback* version is for users who have installed their own fonts for displaying all Chinese characters, and the Chinese characters we have not produced will be empty. The *allideo* version is for users who need to display all Chinese characters with only one font, in which the Chinese characters that have not been produced will be replaced by HanaMin. Both files can be used to find out our current progress.

**Q3**: Why only P1 is divided into two types?

**A3**: Because all characters in extensions G and H, covered by P2, have been produced, so there is no need to divide P2.
