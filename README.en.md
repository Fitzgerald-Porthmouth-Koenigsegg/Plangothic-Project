## Overview
Plangothic Project (Chinese: 遍黑体项目) is based on [Source Han Sans](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans) CN and takes the Chinese Mainland glyphs as the standard to supplement the CJKV Unified ideographic extension. The project was initiated around June 2020.

## Coverage

We have completed except for Extension B. Extension C, D, E, and Extension F require further refinement. Other non-CJK ideographs are partly available.

## FAQ
**Q1**: Why are there two font files for Plangothic?

**A1**: Because the maximum number of glyphs a font can hold is limited (to 65535), while the total number of CJK ideographs is much larger than this value.

**Q2**: What is the difference between *fallback* and *allideo* versions for P1?

**A2**: The *fallback* version is for users who have installed their own fonts for displaying all CJK ideographs, and the CJK ideographs we have not produced will be empty. The *allideo* version is for users who need to display all CJK ideographs with only two fonts, in which the CJK ideographs that have not been produced will be replaced by HanaMin. Both files can be used to find out our current progress.

**Q3**: Why only P1 is divided into two types?

**A3**: Because all characters in extensions G and H, covered by P2, have been produced, so there is no need to divide P2.

**Q4**: Why does this project not include (or include a small amount of) CJK ideographs in the URO and extensions A?

**A4**: Because the purpose of this project is "supplement all the extension blocks of CJK Unified Ideographs based on [Source Han Sans](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans) CN.", if you need to CJK ideographs in the URO and extensions A, you can directly use Source Han Sans. The sporadic CJK ideographs in the URO and extensions A, included in this project are CJK ideographs with glyph changes in Unicode or inconsistent with the purpose of this project. Before adding these CJK ideographs, They have been compared with other mainstream fonts and glyphs in the Unicode.

**Q5**: Will there be a version containing other weight (or other local glyphs) in the future?

**A5**: Because the quantities of this project are too large, so will not have this plan. If you have such an idea, you can make a derivative font version of the project with your requirements.

**Q6**: Why is there no complex text layout (CTL) in this font?

**A6**: Because the use of fonts in this project focuses on tool fonts, that is, they are not responsible for typesetting but only for display, similar to [Noto Unicode](https://github.com/MY1L/Unicode/tree/main/NotoUnicode) developed by [My1l](https://github.com/MY1L), or [Unifont](https://unifoundry.com/unifont). I don't need to accurately typeset so many languages and characters, as long as I can see the characters. If you have such ideas, you can make a derivative font version of the project for your needs.

## Other instructions
1. Everyone is welcome to participate in the production of Plangothic Project. But you need to ensure that you have a certain foundation in the area of glyphs, font beauty, software use, Unicode, and other aspects. In this regard, you can join our QQ group [1135661191](https://jq.qq.com/?_wv=1027&k=xRTzFAfD) for detailed discussion and questioning.
2. This is a long-term project. We would be grateful if you could promote the project to others. We also welcome technical personnel in font production and accept you to continue to improve the font based on this font. You can contact the author through the above contact information. The development of this project is inseparable from your publicity and encouragement.
3. I am not a professional designer so the structure may look ugly, and the words added may be slightly inconsistent with the original version. In addition, due to time constraints, there is no extra time for fine finishing, and the splicing of parts of some characters will be very stiff. But it is better than nothing.
4. **I am a Chinese mainland user, and there is no any overseas discussion group (like Telegram, Discord etc.) in this project. I apologize for the inconvenience caused by overseas users!**
