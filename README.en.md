## Overview
Plangothic Project (Chinese: 遍黑体项目) is based on [Source Han Sans](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans) CN and takes the Chinese Mainland glyphs as the standard to supplement the CJK Unified ideographic extension. The project was initiated around June 2020.

## Coverage

We have completed all CJK extension blocks other than Extension B. Also, Extension C, D, E, F and Extension I require further refinement. Other non-CJK ideographs are partly available.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This font is currently in an unfinished stage and still lacks a large number of CJK ideographs.

## License
This font is derived from Source Han Sans and released under the SIL Open Font License. See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for details. You can:

- Free use, including commercial use, without payment, notification, or identification of the original author.
- Share font files freely and install them on any software or device.
- On this basis, the work shall be modified or re-created. However, the name "Plangothic" and "遍黑" shall not be used for the second modified work. The second modified version shall also be published in SIL Open Font Licenses.

Any individual, enterprise, team, etc. who uses, copies, modifies, distributes this font or conducts any behavior conforming to the provisions of the SIL Open Font License, and the recipient who uses, downloads, or exercises the rights specified in the contract, shall be deemed to have agreed to comply with all the provisions of the SIL Open Font License by default.

It is strictly prohibited for any individual, enterprise, or team to sell the font file (including but not limited to selling the font file separately, bundling it with other fonts, or asking for payment to use the font, etc.). If you have paid for this font, please report immediately and assist the relevant judicial authorities if necessary.

## FAQ
**Q1**: Why are there two font files for Plangothic?

**A1**: Because the maximum number of glyphs a font can hold is limited (to 65535), while the total count of CJK ideographs is much greater than this value.

**Q2**: What is the difference between *fallback* and *allideo* versions for P1?

**A2**: The *fallback* version is suitable for users who currently have installed fonts that **CAN DISPLAY** all CJK ideographs, and the CJK ideographs we have not included will be empty. The *allideo* version is suitable for users who currently have installed fonts that **CANNOT DISPLAY** all CJK ideographs, in which the CJK ideographs that have **NOT** been included will be replaced by the Hanazono Mincho font. Both files can be used to find out our current progress. When this project has completely covered all CJK ideographs, the *fallback* file will be removed.

**Q3**: Why P1 is divided into two types?

**A3**: Because all characters in extensions G and H covered by P2, have been included, so there is no need to divide P2.

**Q4**: Why does this project just include a small amount of CJK ideographs in the URO and extensions A?

**A4**: Since the purpose of this project is "supplement all the extension blocks of CJK Unified Ideographs based on [Source Han Sans](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans) CN", needs of using CJK ideographs in the URO and Extension A blocks can be solved by directly using the Source Han Sans font. As for these CJK ideographs scattered in the URO and Extension A, included in this project are CJK ideographs with glyph changes in Unicode or inconsistent with the purpose of this project. Before adding these CJK ideographs to the project, they have been compared with other mainstream fonts and glyphs in the Unicode.

**Q5**: Will there be a version containing other weights (or other local glyphs) in the future?

**A5**: Since the quantities of this project are too large, so this request is not in our reach by now. If you have such ideas, you can make a derivative font version of the project with your requirements.

**Q6**: Why is there no Complex Text Layout (CTL) in this font?

**A6**: Because the use of fonts in this project focuses on pragmatic tool fonts, that is, they are not responsible for typesetting but only for display, similar to [Noto Unicode](https://github.com/MY1L/Unicode/tree/main/NotoUnicode) developed by [My1l](https://github.com/MY1L), [Unifont](https://unifoundry.com/unifont). Using CTL to typeset and display these languages and/or scripts is outside the coverage of this project. If you have such ideas, you can make a derivative font version of the project for your own needs.

## Other instructions
1. Everyone is welcome to participate in the production of Plangothic Project. But you need to ensure that you have a certain foundation in the area of glyphs, font beauty, software use, Unicode, and other aspects. In this regard, you can join our QQ group [1135661191](https://jq.qq.com/?_wv=1027&k=xRTzFAfD) for detailed discussion and questioning.
2. This is a long-term project. We would be grateful if you could promote the project to others. We also welcome technical personnels in font production and accept you to continue to improve this project. You can contact the author through said information. The development of this project is inseparable from your publicity and encouragement.
3. Members of this project are NOT professional designers so unsightedly structures and inconsistencies with the original font may occur. In addition, due to time constraints, there is little extra time for polishing the font so stiff structring of some glyphs may also occur. Though it is better than nothing, so please forgive.
4. **We members are all from Chinese mainland, due to some reasons we cannot provide overseas discussion groups (Telegram, Discord etc.) of this project. Apologize for the inconvenience!**

    > [!WARNING]
    >
    > This project is prone to copyright disputes, so whether it can be reserved needs to be discussed.
